React.js revolutionizes web development by providing a declarative and efficient way to build interactive user interfaces. As a web developer, mastering React.js is essential for staying at the forefront of modern front-end development.

For instance, delve into code like this:

```jsx
import React, { useState } from "react";

const Counter = () => {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  const increment = () => setCount(count + 1);

  return (
    <div>
      <p>Count: {count}</p>
      <button onClick={increment}>Increment</button>
    </div>
  );
};

export default Counter;
```
